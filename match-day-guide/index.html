      <h1>2025 Firelands United Match Day Guide</h1>
      <p>Greetings! We‚Äôre excited to welcome you to Sandusky, OH for our match. In this match day guide, you‚Äôll find helpful information to make our match up as smooth as possible for your team. Read on and feel free to reach out with any questions!</p>
      
      <h3>üìá Club Contacts</h3>
      <p>Here is a list of important contacts that you may need. If you have any questions, feel free to text or call any of them.</p>
      <p>
        Club Director: Andrew Chwalik - 740.816.7646<br>
        Coach: George Villiers - 567.442.1679<br>
        Coach: Zoe Turner - 419.508.7802<br>
      </p>
      
      <h3>üìç Home Field</h3>
      <p>
        Sports Force Parks at Cedar Point Sports Center<br>
        3115 Cleveland Rd. W<br>
        Sandusky, OH 44870
      </p>

      <p>Whether traveling by bus or car, you can park in the parking lots to the left or right of the main park entrance.
        Google Maps should take you right to the main entrance. There will be more than enough parking for both teams and fans so bring all your supporters!
        There will occasionally be a baseball and/or softball game going on at the Sports Force Complex concurent with our match; if you see the parking lot already filling up, that's why. 
        We unfortunately don‚Äôt have locker rooms so you can make your way to the main soccer field, located directly to the right when walking through the main gate.
        The away team benches are on the southeast side of the field. Once ready, your team can begin warming up on the east half of the field.
        Warm up is able to begin 45 minutes before kickoff.</p>

      <h3>üéüÔ∏è Tickets</h3>
      <p>General admission is FREE! No need to purchase any tickets. Just swing by and enjoy a match.</p>

      <h3>üéôÔ∏è Pregame</h3>
      <p>We attempt to have an official pregame experience at Firelands United home games.
        Please send the lineup (with pronunciations) to hello@firelandsunited.com at least 24 hours before kickoff.
        This will be used for player announcements as well as for recording statistics.
        Just a friendly reminder, you do need to provide your roster to the match day officials.
        There will be an ‚Äúofficial‚Äù referee roster check in 20 minutes before kickoff. This will vary based on the assigned referees. 
        Please have your starters line up, along with the Firelands United starters, between the two benches 7 minutes before kickoff.
        If a youth team is in attendance, we‚Äôll have those players line up as well. One youth player will be paired with one senior player.
        The walkout will start when the announcer begins announcing the starters.</p>

      <h3>üì∫ Stream</h3>
      <p>
        We stream all of our home matches on our YouTube Channel so fans from all over can enjoy the game.
        You can find the stream at the following link. Feel free to share it on your socials and send it directly to your fans so they can watch the match.

      <h3>‚öΩÔ∏è Postgame</h3>
      <p>
        After the match, please ensure that no equipment or garbage is left behind.
        We rent these facilities and want to ensure they stay clean so we can continue to call this our home field.
        Any serious trash or damage to the facilities will be reported to league officials.
        We need to pack up and vacate the park by 12:00pm. Please ensure your players adhere to this timeframe.
        If players want to stick around and chat about the game, they may do so in the parking lot.</p>

      <h3>üëï Kits</h3>
      <p>
        The following graphic (coming soon) shows the colors of our kits for the 2025 season.
        The orange & white kit on the left is our home uniform.
        The jersey is orange & white stripes, shorts are charcoal grey, and the socks are charcoal grey.
        The black & orange kit in the middle is our away uniform.
        The jersey is black with hints of orange, shorts are orange, and socks are orange.
        The blue & white kit on the right is our keeper uniform.</p>
