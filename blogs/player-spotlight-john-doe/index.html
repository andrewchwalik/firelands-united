        <p>Every club has a beginning. Every crest, every chant, every future trophy starts with one name on a contract. Today, Firelands United is proud to announce the first signing in club history: Connor Hauger.</p>
<p>Connor has officially signed on to represent Firelands United in our inaugural 2025 season as we compete in the Northern Ohio Soccer League. And we couldn’t imagine a better player to start this journey with.</p>
<p>When you launch a club from scratch, every decision matters. The first training session. The first jersey design. The first player. That first signature isn’t just ink on paper — it’s a statement of intent. Connor embodies exactly what Firelands United is about: ambition, work rate, leadership, and belief in building something meaningful from the ground up.</p>
<p><strong>Watch him sign the contract: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DICfqFmPrRo/">https://www.instagram.com/reel/DICfqFmPrRo/</a></strong></p>
<p>Connor currently plays his college soccer at Terra State Community College, where he serves as a team captain and holds the distinction of being the leading goal scorer in program history. That doesn’t happen by accident. It takes consistency, hunger, and showing up every single day with something to prove. As a captain, he’s demonstrated leadership both on and off the field — setting standards in training, leading in big moments, and raising the level of those around him. Those are the kinds of players you build a culture around.</p>
<p>Inaugural seasons are special. They’re unpredictable. They’re raw. They’re fueled by belief. As we step into the Northern Ohio Soccer League ready to compete, Connor brings exactly the type of attacking presence and competitive edge we need. He’s coming off a strong first collegiate season and enters 2025 confident and motivated.</p>
<p><strong>In his own words: “I’m excited to bring my talents to Firelands United. I’m feeling strong coming off my first season at Terra. Let’s get this season going!”</strong></p>
<p>That energy is exactly where we are as a club.</p>
<p>This isn’t just about goals. It’s about foundation. The first player in club history will always be remembered. Years from now — when Firelands United has played countless matches, developed rivalries, and created memories across Northern Ohio — Connor Hauger’s name will always be tied to the beginning. He was the first to believe. The first to commit. The first to put pen to paper. And that matters.</p>
<p>Our club founder, Andrew Chwalik, on the signing: &quot;I&#39;ve had the pleasure of coaching Connor at Terra. He&#39;s a heck of a player, both on and off the pitch. He embodies everything we&#39;re looking for in a player. It&#39;s exciting to have him joining Firelands United as the first player in our history!&quot;</p>
<p>As we prepare for kickoff in 2025, this signing marks a milestone for Firelands United. The roster is beginning to take shape. The vision is becoming reality. The story is being written.</p>
<p>Connor Hauger is officially part of it. And he’ll forever hold a special place in Firelands United history. Stay tuned as we continue building toward our inaugural season in the Northern Ohio Soccer League. The foundation is set. Let’s build.</p>
