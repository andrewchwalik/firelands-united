Firelands United is proud to announce the launch of our Women’s First Team, set to compete in the Northern Ohio Soccer League’s main women’s division beginning this May. The season will run from early May through mid-July, marking an exciting new chapter for soccer in the Firelands region. As we prepare for our inaugural campaign, we are actively building the first roster in club history and inviting competitive, driven players to be part of something special from the very beginning.

This is more than just adding another team — it’s about creating opportunity and establishing a standard for women’s soccer in Northern Ohio. Firelands United was founded to develop players, build community, and grow the game in our region, and launching a women’s first team is a natural and important step in that mission.

> “Our goal has always been bigger than just putting a team on the field,” said Andrew Chwalik, Founder of Firelands United. “We’re building a culture. We’re building opportunity. And we’re building a program that young players in this region can aspire to be part of. This inaugural women’s team will set the standard for years to come in our region.”

Players who join this first squad will help shape the identity, culture, and competitive spirit of the program moving forward. If you are looking for high-level summer competition in a positive, driven environment — and want to represent the Firelands with pride — we encourage you to get involved.
