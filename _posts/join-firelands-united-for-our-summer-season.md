Firelands United is officially recruiting players for our inaugural men’s season in the Northern Ohio Soccer League (Northwest Region), and we’re looking for competitors who want to be part of something bigger than just another team.

This summer marks the beginning of a new chapter for soccer in the Firelands region. We’re not just launching a roster — we’re building a club. A culture. A standard. And that starts with the players who are willing to step forward and say, “I want to help build this.”

The Northern Ohio Soccer League provides a competitive platform for top-level amateur and collegiate players who are serious about their development. This is an opportunity to compete at a high level, represent your community, and continue sharpening your game throughout the summer.

But being part of an inaugural season is different.

There’s no history to lean on. No legacy to inherit. The identity of Firelands United will be shaped by the players who wear the badge first. The way we train. The way we compete. The way we carry ourselves on and off the field. That foundation will be built this summer.

We are looking for passionate, driven players who:

* Compete relentlessly
* Value team culture and accountability
* Want high-level training and meaningful matches
* Take pride in representing their region
* Understand that building something from the ground up requires commitment

Whether you’re a current college player looking to stay sharp over the summer, a recent graduate still chasing the game, or a high-level player ready to test yourself in a competitive environment, Firelands United offers a platform to compete and grow.

This is minor league soccer with ambition. We plan to play fast. We plan to play brave. And we plan to compete every time we step on the field.

If you believe you have what it takes — not just talent, but mentality — we want to hear from you.

Submit your information and take the first step toward joining what we believe will be the coolest soccer club in Northern Ohio.

This is your chance to be part of Year One. Be part of the foundation. Be part of the story. See you on the pitch.
